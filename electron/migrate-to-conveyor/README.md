# `migrate-to-conveyor`

This module provides a simple way to migrate your users from an Electron Forge/Builder based Squirrel installation into a new package 
built with [Conveyor](https://www.hydraulic.dev).

Conveyor is an easier and more powerful alternative to Electron Forge/Builder/Installer. It can build self-updating packages for all desktop
operating systems from any OS, can do background and forced-on-launch updates and has many other useful features.
