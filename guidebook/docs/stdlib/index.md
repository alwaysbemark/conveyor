# Standard library

Conveyor ships with some pre-canned config snippets to help you configure your package for popular frameworks and libraries. Often 
these snippets are needed when your app uses native code.

These frameworks have special support:

1. [Java Development Kits](jdks.md) from various vendors
2. [JavaFX](javafx.md)
4. [SWT](swt.md)
