# Samples

Here is a library of examples, demonstrating different features of the product. If you just want an app to experiment with, use the `conveyor generate` command to create one. If you [follow the tutorial](../tutorial.md) then this is what you'll do.

* [JetPack Compose Desktop](jetpack-compose-desktop.md): make a slick GUI app using an adapted version of Android's modern UI toolkit.
* [TeamCity](teamcity.md): see how to package a third party server for Linux without using Conveyor's built in JVM support, with systemd and Apache integration.
* [SWT](swt.md): Demonstrates how to depend on a library with platform specific artifacts.
