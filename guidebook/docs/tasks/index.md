# Tasks

In this section we take a task-oriented approach to using Conveyor. 

## Learn and experiment  

* Use the `conveyor generate` command to create a self-contained, ready to package app in C++, Java, Kotlin or HTML5.
* [Follow the tutorial](../tutorial/1-get-started.md) which takes you through creating and packaging an app.

## Package JVM GUI apps

* [Jetpack Compose Desktop apps](jetpack-compose-desktop.md). Make GUIs using an adapted version of Android's modern UI toolkit.
* [JavaFX](javafx.md): Package your existing JavaFX app, regardless of what build system it uses.
* [SWT](swt.md): Demonstrates how to depend on a library with platform specific artifacts.

## Package server apps

* [Package a third party server for Linux](server.md) that depends on Postgresql, is supervised with systemd and provides reverse proxy configs.
