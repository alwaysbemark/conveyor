# Release notes

## Linux

* Add a new `app.linux.root-inputs` set of keys, which allow files to be placed outside the app install path or prefix. This is useful for adding extra integration points with the OS that Conveyor itself doesn't support.

    For older release notes please use the version picker in the top bar.
