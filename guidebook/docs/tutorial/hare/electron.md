cd my-project
npm install
```

{!tutorial/hare/create-unpackaged-app.md!}

{!tutorial/hare/serve-with-npx.md!}

## Release an update

In another terminal tab:

## Read the config

It looks like this:

```
include required("/stdlib/electron/electron.conf")

// Import metadata from your package.json file and 
// which version of Electron to use.
package-json {
  include required("package-lock.json")
}

app {
  display-name = "My Project"
  rdns-name = com.example.my-project
  site.base-url = "localhost:5000"
  updates = aggressive
  icons = icons/icon.svg
}
```

## Change the icon

The current icon is the Electron logo, which isn't a great choice for your app. Conveyor can draw icons for you.

* [x] Delete the line that says `icons = icons/icon.svg`.
