!!! tip "GitHub support"
    If you use a name like `io.github.your_username.your_repo` your new project will use git, GitHub Releases and GitHub Pages.
    There's also a [GitHub Action Workflow](../../continuous-integration.md#running-conveyor-from-within-github-actions) but that won't be configured out of the box.
