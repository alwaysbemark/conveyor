# Tutorial

In this tutorial we'll generate a fresh application using the templates built in to Conveyor. Then we'll compile a download site for it containing packages for every supported platform. Finally we'll take a look at how things are wired up and thus learn how to package a pre-existing project.

This tutorial doesn't try to cover all the features Conveyor has, it's only here to get you started. Read through the rest of this guidebook to learn about the full range of possibilities.

## Step 1. Setting up

* [x] Follow the instructions in [Setting up](setting-up.md) to install Conveyor and (optionally) supply certificates.
* [x] Pick a URL for hosting your packages. This is where auto-updates will check for new versions. All you need is a directory on a web server. [You can use GitHub Releases](configs/download-pages.md#publishing-through-github) to host your repository files and GitHub Sites to host the generated `download.html` file. For testing you can also use `localhost`.

## Step 2. Create a template project

Conveyor has two pre-canned "Hello World" project templates. One is for a GUI app using [JetPack Compose for Desktop](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-desktop/), and the other uses [JavaFX](https://www.openjfx.io). This is the quickest way to try things out.

* [x] Make sure you have a modern JDK installed, such that you can compile the samples. Conveyor requires JVM apps to use Java 11 or higher.
* [x] Run the following command, picking an app type and reverse DNS name as you see fit - please make sure you double-check the program's output as  well for additional information. There are also `--display-name`, `--output-url` and `--site-url` flags:

```
conveyor generate {javafx,compose} --rdns=com.example.my-project
```

Identifying an app with a reverse DNS name is required for some platforms like macOS, and other needed values can be derived from it. A directory named after the last reverse dns element (in this case `my-project`) will be populated with a buildable project.

We'll explore what's inside the project directory in a bit. For now, note that there's a `conveyor.conf` file at the top level directory.

!!! tip "Reverse DNS names"
    RDNS names are just a naming convention meant to keep apps clearly separated. Actual domain name ownership isn't checked by anything. If you don't have a website consider creating a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account and then using `io.github.youruser.yourproject`, which will ensure no naming conflicts with anyone else.

!!! tip "Cross platform UI"
    JetPack Compose is the next-gen native UI toolkit on Android and it also runs on Windows/Mac/Linux, making it easy to share code between mobile and desktop. [JavaFX also runs on mobile](https://gluonhq.com/products/mobile/) and [the web](https://www.jpro.one).

## Step 3. Build un-packaged apps

* [ ] Change your current directory to the generated project directory (in this example `my-project`) and run the following command to compile the generated sample project: 
````
./gradlew jar
````
!!! tip "Watch-out the program output as well"
As mentioned earlier, please correlate as well this content with the program's output - the `conveyor generate ...` command's output in Step 2 above, gives also the needed directions to complete this specific tutorial step.

!!! tip "Local file-caching  system"
The previous command, as well as the ones in the next section and, the Conveyor system itself are making a heavy use of a local file-caching system, downloading for your project the required libraries and dependencies only once, and re-using them in consequent project builds. Thus, a new download of the same file will be triggered only in case of events like: cache or cache content removal, cache file system location change, etc. 

For more details about the local cache used by the system and advanced management options, please visit https://conveyor.hydraulic.dev/0.16/running/#the-cache   
* [ ] Build a self-contained but un-packaged app for your current platform:

```
# If on Windows:
conveyor make windows-app

# If on Linux:
conveyor make linux-app

# If on macOS, one of the following for Intel/M1 Macs respectively:
conveyor -Kapp.machines=mac.amd64 make mac-app
conveyor -Kapp.machines=mac.aarch64 make mac-app
```

This will compile the project and then create an unzipped, un-packaged app in the `output` directory. 

!!! tip "Error messages"
Forgetting to run the `./gradlew jar` command in the previous step, will result in error messages being printed by the system like bellow and consequently, in an inconsistent project.
````
ðŸ”” There are no JAR files in your inputs. Did you forget to add some?
````


* [ ] Now run the generated program directly in the usual manner for your operating system to check it works.

Because we generated a JVM app, the above commands can be run on any OS in any combination. You should pick the one that matches your machine but only so you can run the results.

The command for macOS is different to those for Windows and Linux because Conveyor supports two CPU architectures for macOS, so you have to disambiguate which you want. The `-K` switch sets a key in the config file for the duration of that command only. Here we're setting the `app.machines` key which controls which targets to create packages for.

## Step 4. Build and serve the download site

* [ ] Request a full build of the download / repository site:

```
conveyor make site
```

The previous contents of the output directory will be replaced. You'll now find there packages for each OS in multiple formats, some update metadata files and a download page ([details](outputs.md)). 

The default generated `conveyor.conf` file tells each package to look for updates on `localhost:8899`. If you want to just quickly test updates this is good enough - grab your favourite web server and serve that directory. We recommend [Caddyserver](https://caddyserver.com/). 

!!! warning 
    The web server must support Content-Range requests. Unfortunately the Python 3 built in web server doesn't.

When you want to serve your packages for real, change the `site.base-url` key in the generated `conveyor.conf` configuration file in the root of your project's directory,  to point to the URL where you'll upload your files and rerun `conveyor make site`. You can also use [GitHub Releases](configs/download-pages.md#publishing-through-github). Note that there's no way to change the site URL after release because it's included in the packages themselves, so pick wisely.

!!! tip "Advanced configuration options"
    The generated project configuration file includes a subset only of the large number of options available  for your project configuration. For a detailed review of the configuration file structure and advanced configuration options please visit the [Writing config files](https://conveyor.hydraulic.dev/0.16/configs/) Conveyor documentation section.

## Step 5. Release an update

The version of the packages is taken from the version defined in the build system. 

* [ ] Open the source code of the app and change the message that's displayed when you click the button. Now change the line in  `build.gradle[.kts]`  that reads `version = "1.0"` to `version = "1.1"`. 
* [ ] Run the following commands:

```
# Rebuild the app with the new version number.
./gradlew jar   

# Rebuild the site.
conveyor make site
```

* [ ] Now copy this directory to your web server using a tool like `scp`, `rsync` or however else you normally publish static web files. If using GitHub Releases, just make a new release with the contents of the site output (don't add  `download.html` to the release, instead add it to your GitHub Pages or equivalent).

??? tip "Faster builds"
    Conveyor builds are incremental and parallel, so you should find that rebuilding the site is much quicker the second time you try it. You can also instantly 'check out' the intermediate files, such as unpacked directories. Run `conveyor make` to see what's available. This lets you rapidly iterate on your packages, because once built it normally only takes a few seconds to create a new spin of your app.
    

    Nonetheless there are ways to make builds faster:
    
    1. Set `app.sign = false` during development to disable code signing and notarization. Notarization takes about two minutes and is unnecessary whilst iterating.
    2. Set `app.linux.compression = low` or `none` to switch to gzip or no compression when building Linux packages. The resulting packages are bigger, but build much faster than when using the default LZMA codec.

Each operating system has its own approach to how and when updates are applied:

* **Debian/Ubuntu derived distros:** `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` as per normal. Updates will also be presented via the normal graphical software update tool, alongside OS updates.
* **macOS:** Updates are downloaded in the background when the app starts if:
    * It's not the first start and it's been more than one hour since the last update check.
    * *or* if the `FORCE_UPDATE_CHECK` environment variable is set. For example you can run `FORCE_UPDATE_CHECK=1 /Applications/YourApp.app/Contents/MacOS/YourApp` from a terminal to force an immediate update check.
    * Once the update is downloaded the user is prompted to install and restart.
    * The update schedule and UI can be adjusted in the config file.
* **Windows:** Updates are checked:
    * If the user re-opens the `.appinstaller` XML file. This is the easiest way to test updates. You don't have to re-download it because the `.appinstaller` file contains its own URL and the "App Installer" app will re-download a fresh copy from the download site when it's opened.
    * Every 8 hours in the background by the OS, regardless of whether the app is being used or not.
    * Optionally, on every app launch with a frequency you can specify. These update checks can be configured to block startup, ensuring that the user is always up to date. [Learn more here](configs/windows.md).

* [ ] You can now test the update procedure. 

??? tip "Windows package management"
    MSIX files are conceptually similar to Linux packages and they share many of the same features. An MSIX package is simply a signed zip with some additional metadata in XML files that define how the package should be integrated with the OS (e.g. start menu entries, adding programs to the %PATH% etc).
    

    MSIX and the features it offers are [described in the "Outputs" section](outputs.md). You can control MSIX packages from the command line using PowerShell, for example with the [Add-AppxPackage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/appx/add-appxpackage?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.
    
    A useful tool is [MSIX Hero](https://msixhero.net/), which is a sophisticated GUI tool for the package manager. It allows you to explore the contents of packages, force update checks, run apps inside the MSIX container and more.

## Step 6. Explore the integration

In this section you'll learn how to add Conveyor packaging to an existing project by studying how the sample projects are configured.

* [ ] Open `conveyor.conf` in the project root directory. It's defined using a superset of JSON called [HOCON](configs/hocon-spec.md) with a few [Conveyor-specific extensions](configs/hocon-extensions.md). It should look like this:

```javascript title="conveyor.conf"
include "/stdlib/jdk/17/openjdk.conf"   // (1)!
include "#!./gradlew -q printConveyorConfig"  // (2)!

app {
  display-name = My Amazing Project   // (3)!
  site.base-url = downloads.myproject.org/some/path   // (4)!
  
  inputs += "icons/*.png"  // (5)!
  icons = "icon-square-*.png"
  mac.icons = "icon-rounded-*.png"
}

conveyor.compatibility-level = 1   // (6)!
```

1. You can import JDKs by major version (optionally also the minor version) and by naming a specific distribution. [Learn more](stdlib/jdks.md).
2. This is a [hashbang include](configs/hocon-extensions.md#including-the-output-of-external-commands). The given program will be run and the output included as if it were a static HOCON file.
3. You may not need to set this if the display name of your project is trivially derivable from the name of the Gradle project. Use `printConveyorConfig` to see what the plugin guessed.
4. This is where the created packages will look for update metadata.
5. The templates come with pre-rendered icons in both square and rounded rectangle styles. This bit of config uses square by default and rounded rects on macOS only, but that's just a style choice to fit in with the native expectations. You can use whatever icons you like. They should be rendered as PNGs in a range of square sizes, ideally 32x32, 64x64, 128x128 etc up to 1024x1024.
6. This line will be added to a freshly written config if it's missing. Recording the schema/semantics expected by the config allows the format to evolve in future versions without breaking backwards compatibility.

This sample is small, as most Conveyor configs are. A combination of sensible defaults, automatically derived values and (optionally) config extracted from your build system keeps it easy. Still, there are around 150 different settings available to customize packages if you need them. Consult the configuration section of this guide to learn more about what you can control.

### Gradle projects

You don't have to use any particular build system with Conveyor, but if you use Gradle then config can be extracted from your existing build using a simple plugin. The Gradle plugin doesn't replace or drive the package build process itself: you still do that using the `conveyor` command line tool. The plugin is narrowly scoped to generating configuration and nothing more. If you want Gradle to run Conveyor you can add a normal exec task to do so.

The plugin adds two tasks, `printConveyorConfig` and `writeConveyorConfig`. The first prints the generated config to stdout, and the second writes it to an output file. By default this is called `generated.conveyor.conf` but can be changed.

* [ ] Run `./gradlew -q printConveyorConfig` and examine the output. The plugin can read config from other plugins like the Java application plugin, the JetPack Compose plugin and the OpenJFX plugin.
* [ ] Open `settings.gradle{.kts}` file. The following bit of code adds support for loading the Gradle plugin:

=== "Kotlin"
    ```kotlin title="settings.gradle.kts"
    pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            gradlePluginPortal()
            maven("https://maven.hq.hydraulic.software")
        }
    }
    ```

=== "Groovy"
    ```groovy title="settings.gradle"
    pluginManagement {
        repositories {
            gradlePluginPortal()
            maven { uri = "https://maven.hq.hydraulic.software" }
        }
    }
    ```

* [ ] Open `build.gradle{.kts}` file. It should apply the Conveyor plugin at the top:

=== "Kotlin"
    ```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
    plugins {
        id("dev.hydraulic.conveyor") version "0.9.8"
    }
    ```
=== "Groovy"
    ```groovy title="build.gradle"
    plugins {
        id 'dev.hydraulic.conveyor' version '0.9.8'
    }
    ```

[Get the latest version number and plugins code snippet here](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/dev.hydraulic.conveyor).

The hashbang include you saw earlier will run Gradle each time you invoke Conveyor to extract config. This approach adds a slight delay to each Conveyor run, because even with the Gradle daemon this process isn't instant, but it does mean your config is always synced.

You can also write `include required("generated.conveyor.conf")` and run `gradle writeConveyorConfig` when you change your Gradle build. This avoids any delay from involving Gradle but means your settings can get out of sync.

!!! tip
    When iterating on packages use the faster form, and then switch to the slower form when done.

??? "Why does the plugin only generate config?"
    Conveyor isn't implemented itself as a Gradle plugin because:
    
    * It will support non-JVM apps in the near future.
    * It must support projects that use any build system.
    * It needs a customized JVM that has various bug fixes backported to it, and which thus won't match the one being used to run Gradle.
    * The Gradle API frequently changes in backwards-incompatible ways.


### Maven projects

For Maven there's no plugin. Instead Conveyor will read the project classpath by running the output of the `mvn` command and using it directly as configuration. Other aspects like project name must be specified explicitly. Better import from Maven is planned in a future release.

??? warning "Maven on Windows"
    Currently, automatic import from Maven only works on UNIX. On Windows you'll need to follow the instructions below for "other build systems". 

??? note "JavaFX apps"
    This framework has special support in the [standard library](stdlib/javafx.md). Check there to learn what else you'll want to add, or look at the [samples](samples/index.md).

Here's an example of how to package a Maven project:

```javascript title="conveyor.conf" linenums="1"
include "/stdlib/jdk/17/openjdk.conf"  // (1)!
include "/stdlib/jvm/from-maven.conf"  // (2)!

app {
    fsname = my-program  // (3)!
    display-name = myPROGRAM  // (4)!
    vendor = Global MegaCorp  // (5)!
    version = 1.0
    
    site.base-url = downloads.myproject.org/some/path  // (6)!
    inputs += "icon-*.png"
}
```

1. You can import JDKs by major version, major/minor version, and by naming a specific distribution.
2. This included file contains a single line, which runs Maven, tells it to print out the classpath and assigns the result to the `app.inputs` key: `include "#!=app.inputs mvn -q dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=/dev/stdout -Dmdep.pathSeparator=${line.separator}"`. 
3. The `fsname` is what's used for names on Linux e.g. in the `bin` directory, for directories under `lib`. In fact when specified the vendor is also used, and the program will be called `global-megacorp-my-program` unless the `long-fsname` key is overridden.
4. You may not need to set this if the display name of your project is trivially derivable from the fsname. The default here would be `My Program`.
5. This is optional. It'll be prefixed to the display name and used as a directory name  in various places; skip it if you don't work for an organization.
6. This is where the created packages will look for update metadata.

### Other build systems

Create a `conveyor.conf` that looks like this:

```javascript title="conveyor.conf" linenums="1"
include "/stdlib/jdk/17/openjdk.conf"  // (1)!

app {
    inputs += build/jars/my-program-1.0.jar
    inputs += build/jars
    inputs += "icon-*.png"

    vendor = Global MegaCorp  // (2)!
    
    site.base-url = downloads.myproject.org/some/path  // (3)!
}
```

1. You can import JDKs by major version, major/minor version, and by naming a specific distribution.
2. This is optional. It'll be prefixed to the display name and used as a directory name  in various places; skip it if you don't work for an organization.
3. This is where the created packages will look for update metadata.

??? note "File paths"
    Inputs are resolved relative to the location of the config file, not where Conveyor is run from.

??? warning "Uber-jars"
    Don't use an uber/fat-jar for your program. It'll reduce the efficiency of delta download schemes like the one used by Windows. It also means modular JARs won't be encoded using the optimized `jimage` scheme. Use separate JARs for the best user experience.

This configuration adds your app's main JAR as the first input, allowing package metadata like version numbers and names to be derived from the file name. Then it adds the directory containing all the app  JARs (duplicates are ignored), and finally a set of icon files.

That's all you need! The display name and version of your application will be taken from the file name by default ("My App" and "1.0" given the file name in the example above).  

## Next steps

Not happy with the defaults? There are [lots of settings](configs/index.md) available, including settings that expose platform specific metadata and features.

Conveyor also supports servers with full Linux `systemd` integration. Take a look at the [Linux config sections](configs/linux.md) to learn more.
